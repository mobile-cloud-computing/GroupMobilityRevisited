# Revisiting Group Mobility Modelling- A Systematic Evaluation

<b>ShapeFiles:</b> Shape files for mapping nodes over the map. <br>

<b>ProcessingFiles:</b> <br>
   * Step 1 - Data Preprocessing till Grid making <br>
    Preprocessing steps include merging coordinates, then verifying data from OpenCelliD. <br>
    Creating a grid and selecting stations from inside the grid. <br>
   * Step 2 - Filtering Data from Interested Area <br>
    Filtering data of Selected area from the main dataset and creating a new data file for further studies. <br>
   * Step 3 -  10th Percentile <br>
    Studying and making trajectories for the users with samples division of the 10th percentile category. <br>
   * Step 3 -  50th Percentile <br>
    Studying and making trajectories for the users with samples division of the 50th percentile category. <br>
   * Step 3 -  90th Percentile <br>
    Studying and making trajectories for the users with samples division of the 90th percentile category. <br>
   * Step 4 - Similarity scores calculations (6.1, 6.2 and 6.4) <br>
    Calculating mobility and similarity scores for homogeneous trajectories including selective and all users from each consideration. <br>
   * Step 5 - Similarity scores calculations - heterogeneous similarity (6.3) <br>
    Extracting group mobility and finding similarities of heterogeneous trajectory groups.<br>
